Testing Altium 17 SVN
I want to test the features of SVN from Altium Designer 17. Now this won't help my fellow classmates as we cannot download anything onto the local machines, BUT its good practice for me to understand how to use SVN works and integrates with Altium. I want to be able to work on multiple user teams and create boards as a group. This will help facilitate that. 

I am told all I do is create a repo like normal, use my favorite client (command line!!!) and use git like normal. Of course, replacing git commands with svn commands.
